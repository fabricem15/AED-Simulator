# AED Simulator
Implementation of an Automated External Defibrillator simulator using Qt Designer and C++. The system allows users to select several test cases and simulate device interaction based on various patients' conditions.

## GUI 
Our GUI features a high-fidelity prototype of the AED device that allows the user to interact with an accurate simulation of the real device. The main features include: 
1. A timer for the running device
2. A progress bar for the battery health
3. A progress bar to model the compression depth
4. Labels to model flashing lights
5. Buttons for user actions
6. A slider for setting the compression depth.

## Setup Instructions 
1. Download or clone the source code in a Linux environment
2. Open Qt Creator and navigate to the repository location in your file system
3. Launch the program in Qt to interact with the GUI and run the simulation

**Note that it is recommended to use a larger screen to see the full GUI window. You may run into scaling issues when running it on a regular laptop screen.**
